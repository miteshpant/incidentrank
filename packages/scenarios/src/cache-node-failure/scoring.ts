 * Cache Node Failure's own scoring configuration — no duplicate/lost-
 * write modeling for this incident (it is an availability/capacity
 * incident, not a correctness one), so dataIntegrity awards full marks
 * via a single catch-all band, matching every other non-correctness
 * built-in scenario. costEfficiency is banded on costIncreaseRatio since
 * both real levers here (cache node count, application concurrency) have
 * authored per-unit costs. operationalEfficiency penalizes the
 * aggressive-warming and concurrency-scaling traps via the generic
 * harmfulChangeCount measure — no scenario-specific scorer code.
