 * Autoscaling Failure's own scoring configuration — no provider-recovery
 * semantics, reliability weighted on time spent in a critical
 * capacity-constrained state generically (criticalTimeRatio). See
 * docs/implementation_plan/phase6.md's scoring-convergence mandate.
 * costEfficiency bands are calibrated so the real fix (raising
 * maxInstanceCount, a genuine cost increase) still scores well overall —
 * the point is not to penalize the correct fix for costing something,
 * only to penalize wasteful/ineffective spending.
